CONCLUSION

Algorand is a new cryptocurrency that confirms transactions on the order of a minute with a negligible probability of fork- ing. Algorand’s design is based on a cryptographic sortition mechanism combined with the BA⋆ Byzantine agreement protocol. Algorand avoids targeted attacks at chosen partic- ipants using participant replacement at every step. Exper- imental results with a prototype of Algorand demonstrate that it achieves sub-minute latency and 125× the throughput of Bitcoin, and scales well to 500,000 users.
